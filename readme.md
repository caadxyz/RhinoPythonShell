# RhinoPythonShell

inspired by [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell)

The RhinoPythonShell adds an IronPython interpreter to  Rhino3d. 

The RhinoPythonShell lets you to write scripts for Rhino3d in Python. But even better, it provides you with an
interactive shell that lets you see the results of your code *as you type it*. This is great for exploring the [rhinscriptsyntax](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/), scriptcontext, [RhinoCommon](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/R_Project_RhinoCommon.htm) API while 
writing your Rhino.python script. 

## Features

- batteries included! (rhinoscriptsyntax, scriptcontext)
